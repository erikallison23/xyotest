        <h2>THE FUTURE</h2>
        <p>We believe the current location technologies lack the necessary certainty and security properties necessary to move
          us into the future. We have developed an ecosystem of crypto-location protocols and components, which leverage
          the strengths of blockchain technologies, and solve the short-comings of location technologies relied upon today.</p>
        <p>Our project is called the "XY Oracle Network" (XYO Network). The XYO Network enables trustless transactions through
          an ecosystem of crypto-location components that can bridge the gap from the world of today, to the world of tomorrow.</p>

        <h1>Bitcoin is just a small fraction</h1>
        <h1>of what's to come</h1>

        <p>When Bitcoin arrived in 2009, it transformed how people carried out transactions online. It made online transactions
          safer, faster and more efficient; millions of people around the world started using and investing in it.</p>

        <p>Today the combined market value of all digital currencies is over $400 billion… and some experts predict Bitcoin
          alone could hit the $1 trillion mark by the end of the year.</p>

        <p>But why is this revolution happening in the first place? It's primarily due to the technology at the foundation of
          it all, a breakthrough called "blockchain".
        </p>

        <p>Blockchain, the fundamental technology underlying Bitcoin, eliminates the need for trust because it makes all transactions
          transparent, decentralized and secure. It has quite literally revolutionized online commerce.</p>

        <p>People can now transact without knowing one another in what are called "trustless" transactions. There’s no need
          for a trusted third-party to settle disputes. People can send money from one person to another without a bank sitting
          in-between, taking a fee.</p>

        <p>And then there was an even bigger breakthrough...</p>




        <h1>So, what does XYO even do?</h1>

        <h1>Meet</h1>
        <h2>Etherum</h2>

        <p>In 2013, there was another breakthrough...</p>
        <p>A new blockchain platform called "Ethereum" was developed. It introduced a Turing-complete programming language into
          blockchain and opened up a new world of possibilities.</p>
        <p>To understand how it works, think of Bitcoin as the Calculator app on your phone, And Ethereum as your phone's operating
          system which allows you to have many apps with many features. One of the main features built into Ethereum's functionality
          are called "smart contracts" - transaction protocols that essentially collapse payment and execution of an agreement
          into the same thing.</p>
        <p>Instead of contracts being written on a piece of paper and signed in black ink, the world of Ethereum allows them
          to be written in computer code and executed when certain conditions are met. For instance, imagine if you want
          to place a $20 bet that a certain sports team will win a game. You can write a smart contract, and when the game
          is over, it checks the score and automatically send $20 worth of Ether (ETH) from loser to the winner.</p>

        <h1>BLOCKCHAIN TECH AND</h1>
        <h1>THE REAL WORLD.</h1>
        <h1>A TRUE STORY</h1>

        <p>Bitcoin and blockchain technologies have been limited to the internet. Every single new blockchain technology, cryptocurrency,
          or new "token", which are all economic tools used to align the underlying platform's economy, have focused on online
          applications, and not offline ones.</p>

        <p>et the offline, real world market is still the biggest. It’s worth over $11 trillion a year. Since 2012, we've been
          developing location-based technologies aimed at connecting the digital world to the real world.</p>

        <p>For the last several years, the XY has been developing the technologies critical to bringing blockchain to the offline
          world, in order to make them programmable and accessible to smart contracts.</p>

        <p>To make this possible, we’ve had to overcome two extraordinarily difficult tasks: First, we've created a location-based
          consumer product business focused on getting Bluetooth and GPS tracking beacons out into the world. And second,
          we've developed ground-breaking research within the realm of location-focused blockchain technology so it is no
          longer limited to the online world.</p>

        <h2>Decentralized</h2>
        <h2>Cryptolocation</h2>

        <p>The XYO Network makes it possible for smart contracts to access the real world by using the XYO Network's ecosystem
          of devices to determine if an object is at a specific XY-coordinate. If it is, one can set up applications which
          execute transactions in the smart contract.</p>
        <p>This has opened up a new world of possibilities. The applications of such a technology are infinite.</p>
        <p>Take for example an eCommerce Company. With the XYO Network, they could now offer their premium customers payment-upon-delivery
          services. To be able to offer this service, the eCommerce company would leverage the XYO Network (which uses XYO
          Tokens) to write a smart contract.</p>
        <p>The XYO Network could then track the location of the package being sent to the consumer along every single step of
          fulfillment; from the warehouse shelf to the shipping courier, all the way into the consumer's house and every
          location in between. This could enable eCommerce retailers and websites to verify, in a trustless way, that the
          package not only appeared on the customer's doorstep, but also safely inside their home.</p>
        <p>Once the package has arrived in the customer's home (defined and verified by a specific XY-Coordinate), the shipment
          is considered complete and the payment to the vendor gets released. The eCommerce integration of the XYO Network
          enables the ability to protect the merchant from fraud and ensure consumers only pay for goods that arrive in their
          home.</p>

        <p>According to a recent study released by Comcast, more than 30% of Americans have had a package stolen from their
          porch or doorstep. As the market share of eCommerce continues to grow, this problem will only become more prevalent.
          By utilizing the XYO Network and XYO Tokens, companies like Amazon and UPS can offer, as a premium service, an
          independently confirmed ledger to track every step of a shipment’s progress, starting at the fulfillment center
          and ending with the package’s secure delivery within the customer’s home.</p>
